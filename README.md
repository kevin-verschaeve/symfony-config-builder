# Symfony config tree builder builder

Writing configuration for a bundle, and specifically the TreeBuilder part can be annoying and error prone.

This app aims to help you build this TreeBuilder with a simple graphical interface.

You can add any nodes as needed and when you are done, copy the result (that is refreshed instantly on update)
and paste it into your Symfony project.
